# Resolution Playbook

## Standard Troubleshooting Flow
1. Confirm the issue and reproduce if possible
2. Gather environment details (model, conditions, recent changes)
3. Check simplest causes first (power, settings, connections)
4. Document every step and result
5. Resolve or escalate with a clear summary

## Escalation Rules
Escalate when:
- Safety risk is present
- Issue is repeatable and unresolved after standard steps
- Suspected hardware failure under warranty
- Firmware/update failure persists after standard recovery steps

## Required Notes on Every Case
- What was tested
- What changed
- What fixed it (or why it was escalated)
- Preventive recommendation
